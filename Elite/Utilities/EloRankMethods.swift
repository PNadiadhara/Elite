// k factor will adjust based on users # of games played
// higher k factors create more volitile shifts in elo ranking, with lower k factor resulting in less volitile shifts
// these results for n factor of 400. (n is const set arbitrarily, used by the world chess federation)
// K=40 for new players until they play 30 games
// K=20 for players with > 30 games and never had an ELO > 2400
// K=10 for players with > 30 games and have had an ELO > 2400
// n value is the same as FIDE(chess elo ranking) this is always a positive value
